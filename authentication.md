# Explore and test MailUp REST API with one click
This repository holds a series of Postman collections demonstrating a variety of use cases for the MailUp REST API. More information about our APIs can be found on [this page](http://help.mailup.com/display/mailupapi/Getting+started+with+the+MailUp+API).

These examples have been created for use with the Postman utility. Postman is a testing framework for REST APIs. The tool can be downloaded from www.getpostman.com.

For each one of these use cases we provide a "**Run in Postman**" button to download the use cases and test them with your account and a **public documentation page** that you can browse if you simply want to learn which methods have to be used to implement a specific behavior.

Each collection contains placeholders with the following format {{MY_KEY}}. You should replace them with the values that are related to your account.

## [Authentication and resource access](auth)
MailUp APIs use different authentication methods and you may need to use more than one when developing your application. 
Basically, transactional APIs for email and SMS use their own methods, while the other API methods require OAuth 2.0. An extensive tutorial on how to access MailUp resources is provided as well. Please read the [Public documentation page](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/1277067/mailup-authentication/2PNCsE) first, then run the collection in Postman using your account credentials.
